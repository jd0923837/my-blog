# my-blog
A sample page for a blog site revolving around authors and their works. You can't actually make posts or change your profile, but it works as a concept. Also, none of the posts are real, as a disclaimer.

# functionality
There is a user page and an author page, but the only author page that works currently is Jeff Kinney's. A homepage button (posts) and back to top button are also present. Perhaps in the future I may come back and add the other features.
